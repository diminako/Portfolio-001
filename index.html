                    <p>
                        My name is Dimitri Nakos and I am an aspiring Full-Stack web developer with a
                        unique background
                        of
                        diagnosing Volkswagens for the past decade. I'm 35 years old and have grown up and still live in
                        Charlotte, NC. I spend my spare time camping, climbing, and if I can ever find time to go to the
                        beach surfing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the weekends you will find me waking up early and teaching myself to code while I have coffee
                        and alone time. While I was a child playing Final Fantasy games on the Super Nintendo the only
                        thing I imagined myself becoming as I grew up was a programmer. I never realized how realistic
                        of a goal it was to obtain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the past 10 years I've spent building a career diagnosing and fixing Volkswagens at
                        dealerships across Charlotte. The past few years I began to lose interest in continuing to do
                        this as a profession and found myself looking for a new and challenging adventure for a career.
                        I have a few friends who are web developers, DevOps engineers, and Database Engineers. They all
                        steered me towards teaching myself web development. And when Covid hit it gave me the perfect
                        opportunity to see if it was the right fit for me. I struggled for the first couple months to
                        understand javaScript fundamentals. But when it finally clicked I realized this is the path I
                        wanted to pursue.
